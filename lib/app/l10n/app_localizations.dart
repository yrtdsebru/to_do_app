/// Callers can lookup localized strings with an instance of L10n

/// Applications need to include `L10n.delegate()` in their app's
/// `localizationDelegates` list, and the locales they support in the app's
/// `supportedLocales` list. For example:
///
/// ```dart
/// import 'l10n/app_localizations.dart';
///

///   localizationsDelegates: L10n.localizationsDelegates,
///   supportedLocales: L10n.supportedLocales,

///
/// ## Update pubspec.yaml
///
/// Please make sure to update your pubspec.yaml to include the following
/// packages:
///
/// ```yaml
/// dependencies:
///   # Internationalization support.
///   flutter_localizations:
///     sdk: flutter
///   intl: any # Use the pinned version from flutter_localizations
///
///   # Rest of dependencies
/// ```
///
/// ## iOS Applications
///
/// iOS applications define key application metadata, including supported
/// locales, in an Info.plist file that is built into the application bundle.
/// To configure the locales supported by your app, you’ll need to edit this
/// file.
///
/// First, open your project’s ios/Runner.xcworkspace Xcode workspace file.
/// Then, in the Project Navigator, open the Info.plist file under the Runner
/// project’s Runner folder.
///
/// Next, select the Information Property List item, select Add Item from the
/// Editor menu, then select Localizations from the pop-up menu.
///
/// Select and expand the newly-created Localizations item then, for each
/// locale your application supports, add a new item and select the locale
/// you wish to add from the pop-up menu in the Value field. This list should
/// be consistent with the languages listed in the L10n.supportedLocales
/// property.
